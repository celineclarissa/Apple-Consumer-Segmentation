# Apple Brand Appeal - Consumer Segmentation

# Abstract 📱
Apple Inc.’s marketing strategies are reported to impact university students’ consumption behavior. However, previous studies focused on overall students, not specifically on international students in China. This demographic has a more equal exposure to both cultures. Quantitative and qualitative approaches were used to study 52 international students at a Sino-foreign university, utilizing surveys, proceeded with data clustering and statistical analyses. Results show that within the demographic, there were two groups with different perceptions towards Apple products: skeptic and enthusiast, directly influencing purchase intentions. Findings align with previous research about university students’ and society’s view on Apple products.

## Introduction 🍎
Apple Inc. is a world-renowned company specializing in technological products such as iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, to AirPods and other electrical accessories. Their choice of design style in goods and their unique brand presence act as an appeal to customers. This aligns with Apple Inc.’s core branding strategy: empathy, focus, impute, which are reflected in how they utilize humanity, building emotional bonds with users and affecting consumer behavior (Cai & Chen, 2024).

China, with a population of 1.4 billion (World Bank, 2024), acts as a prominent market for Apple Inc.’s brand expansion. This includes Shenzhen, an economic and technological hub, and a rising immigrant city (Information Office of Shenzhen Municipal Government). One of the institutions attracting international students is The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen), a university promoting cultural exchange among their students. International students at CUHK-Shenzhen are exposed to both western and eastern media, culture, and technologies. Past studies have examined about Apple Inc.’s marketing strategy in China and other countries, but little is known about how it affects the perception and behavior of international students who have a more equal access to both environments. Therefore, this research aims to bridge that gap, providing information for both companies to further assess current initiatives towards this market segment and the people.
